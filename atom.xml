    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first time I met my cat was a few years ago. She was a kitten back then. I guess she was three or four months old. I found her in the house yard without a sign for her mother or siblings, so I decided to try to gain her trust and become her human friend. It was not the first time I tried to get closer to cats and be her friend. So I had a little experience in how can I get her trust. I managed to gain her trust by giving her food and gradually getting closer to her.</p><span id="more"></span><p>My mother doesn‚Äôt like cats at all; she doesn‚Äôt allow me to have pets inside our home, so in the first few weeks with my new cat, she used to pass by our house every day looking for me and hoping that I will bring her something to eat or she will sit in my lap and I will cuddle her and massage her body. After a while, I started sneaking her into our house frequently, keeping her inside the guest‚Äôs room, and bringing her some food to eat. And she used to sneak into our home by herself also. She would always go inside our house if she found the front door opened. She will go after that either to the kitchen to look for some food or to the guest‚Äôs room where I used to hide her from my mother.</p><p>She wasn‚Äôt only my cat. I saw her many times sitting in front of my uncle‚Äôs house waiting for my cousin to get her some food. But I think I was her favorite human friend. Between all of the humans she knew, I think she has spent most of her time with me. She sits a lot in my lap, she keeps rubbing her body with me, saying that she claims me, and she bites me from time to time. And whenever one of my two nephews sees her, he calls me and asks me to help him feeding her or playing with her. I‚Äôve also taught her a small trick to be able to call her and make her come to me if she‚Äôs somewhere close to me. Whenever I snap my fingers she immediately comes to me. I used to snap my finger everytime I gave her something to eat, so whenever I snap my fingers she runs towards me asking for food.</p><iframe height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K83ZiPpUr9c" style="width:100%;"></iframe><p>As far as I know, my cat has given birth three times. The first time she gave birth was more than three or four years ago. She sneaked into the guest‚Äôs room and gave birth to her children in an empty flower‚Äôs basket. My mother got very angry at me that day when she saw the blood in the guest‚Äôs room, and I was so thrilled because I finally had grandchildren :3. I had to move my cat out of the guest‚Äôs room and find them another place to stay in. I remember that day I tried to get her away from her kittens so I could move them, but she refused to leave her babies. I tried to offer her some food to eat and distract her but she didn‚Äôt eat anything. And when I held the basket to move her babies outside the house, she became very angry and started hissing at me. I moved my cat and her babies to somewhere else I prepared for them, and visited them frequently to give them some food and check my grandchildren. Few weeks later, she changed the location of her kittens to another place and I haven‚Äôt seen them after that. But I had the feeling that they couldn‚Äôt make it, and they have died few months after she has changed their location üòû.</p><p>The second time my cat had given birth was also in the guest‚Äôs room. It was two years ago. She gave birth in the same basket she gave birth in the first time. My mom was mad at me again :/ and I had to move them somewhere else. I built a small house with a barrel surrounding a tree. I made sure that the house is clean, has moderate temperature, and that it‚Äôs very difficult for her to grab her children from their necks, climb the tree and change their location again. And I kept visiting my cat and bring some food with me for her and her kitten.</p><p>After few weeks, I found my cat‚Äôs kitten inside the guest‚Äôs room; She has sneaked into the guest‚Äôs room from the opened window and moved all of her four kittens there. I tried to return them back to their previous house, but she moved them again to the yard in front of the guest‚Äôs room window. I tried to keep my cat and her kitten in the guest‚Äôs room for a couple of days, but I was exposed after that and I had to move them out again, and whenever I get them out of the house, my cat tries to sneak her kittens to the guest‚Äôs room again.</p><iframe height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nK1C1ns2JTM" style="width:100%;"></iframe>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALDBzB_Tjmg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALDBzB_Tjmg</a><br/><br/>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LODf85FN2Pk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LODf85FN2Pk</a><br/><br/><p>I‚Äôve learned a lot about cats with my cat and her four kittens. I remember one day she was sitting on the couch in the guest‚Äôs room watching me playing with her children, and she suddenly walked towards me and started licking me. I found out at that time how much does she love me. I‚Äôve also learned some tricks of how I can limp and relax her kittens while I‚Äôm holding them and prevent them from struggling me, however that trick didn‚Äôt always work, and they scratch my hand sometimes.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/my-cat/my-cat.png"></p><p>Sadly, all of the four kittens have died üòû. It was a very stupid idea of me to allow my cat to keep her kittens around my house. All of the four kittens died because of that decision. Two of the kittens have died while my nephews were playing with them. When I arrived home that night, I was told that two of the kittens had died, and that my nephew feels sad and regrets that. He promised me that from now on he will never allow anyone from his friends to play with the other two kittens and that he will be nice with them. The other two kittens have died a couple of months later üòû. I feel very sorry for my cat üòû She‚Äôs the saddest cat I have ever seen.</p><p>After her four kittens had died, I knew that the best thing for my cat is for her to live away from humans. I stopped giving her food as much as I used to do, stopped sneaking her inside the house, stopped cuddling her ,and stopped allowing her to sleep in my lap anymore. I remember that after few months her looks has changed to me. Whenever I meet her in the street, she keeps looking at me waiting for me to do something like ordering her to follow me by snapping my fingers or going towards her and holding her or massaging her head.</p><p>The third time she gave birth was around a month ago. I knew that after I saw her on the street and saw her belly dangling, which means she has given birth not a long time ago. I felt happy for her because she has given birth to her kittens away from humans.</p><p>I saw my cat few days after that with three little kittens around her, they had a different color from their previous brothers. In her first and second birth, her kittens had a yellow/golden hair color just like their mother‚Äôs, but in her last birth, all of her kitten‚Äôs hair color was gray.</p><p>And a week ago, after I arrived home, I noticed that she has moved her kittens to our house‚Äôs yard.</p><iframe height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jgpif1I0NiY" style="width:100%;"></iframe><p>It was so sad to see two of the three kittens with her üòû. I offered them some food, tried to play with my cat‚Äôs children but they were scared of me and they didn‚Äôt get close to me without their mother coming closer to me at first. After they finished their meal, I moved them to somewhere else.</p><iframe height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tnvSKN3zoKc" style="width:100%;"></iframe><p>I‚Äôve noticed today that my cat has moved her kittens to another place, and I think this is the best thing she has made for her new kittens.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I work on developing a new project, I always look for open source libraries and projects on Github to save me from reinventing the wheel. But in some cases, the code has issues or doesn‚Äôt fulfill my project requirements, and that‚Äôs when I modify the original code and create pull requests with my changes. <span id="more"></span> Here are some of the pull requests I‚Äôve created on Github in the past years.</p><h2 id="Flutter-Cupertino-Date-Picker"><a href="#Flutter-Cupertino-Date-Picker" class="headerlink" title="Flutter Cupertino Date Picker. "></a>Flutter Cupertino Date Picker. <a href="https://github.com/imshashank/flutter-cupertino-date-picker/pull/2"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></h2><p>Flutter Cupertino Date Picker is a package that adds a nice Cupertino date picker to your Flutter application.</p><p>I used this library in one of my freelancing projects to display a nice datepicker to the users.</p><p>In my pull request, I fixed a typo in an Arabic word, and I fixed one line of code that was deprecated in the flutter version I was using in my project.</p><h2 id="Chrome-Response-Override"><a href="#Chrome-Response-Override" class="headerlink" title="Chrome Response Override. "></a>Chrome Response Override. <a href="https://github.com/Pasupathi-Rajamanickam/chrome-response-override/pull/9"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></h2><p>Chrome Response Override is a Chrome devtools extension to modify response on the fly. I recommend using this extension for ‚Äòdebugging‚Äô a webpage response. This extension is a better option than downloading binaries for applications in order to be able to intercept and modify responses.</p><p>I saw a website that takes the user input and sends it to a service running on its server to serve the user request. The website encrypts the data on the browser and sends the encrypted data to the server. I guess that website was doing that to make it hard for developers to use their service by calling the service endpoint immediately.</p><p>It was a challenge for me to find out the code that is responsible for encrypting the request body before sending it to the server. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/Pasupathi-Rajamanickam/chrome-response-override">Chrome Response Override</a> extension, I was able to eliminate all files that has nothing to do with the encryption, and I was able to analyze a bundled script content and extract the part of code that encrypts the data üòÑ.</p><p>The extension was developed originally for replacing words in the response. I‚Äôve made some modifications in the extension to add the support for replacing the whole code of a response. I‚Äôve also added <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> code editor to make it easy to modify the code from Chrome devtools.</p><h2 id="Story-View"><a href="#Story-View" class="headerlink" title="Story View.

I used this package in one of my projects where I needed to develop a story in users profiles. I‚Äôm very grateful for <a href="https://github.com/blackmann">Degreat</a> for this awesome package that he has developed.</p><p>The Story View package has an issue in supporting RTL. The story‚Äôs progress bars on the top doesn‚Äôt go from RTL. The gestures don‚Äôt change on RTL layout also. And gestures stop working when there‚Äôs a layout on top of it.</p><p>I also needed to add more functionalities to the story widget, including adding custom gestures like double click for like, and fix an issue where some of the content should be out of the mobile <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SafeArea-class.html">SafeArea</a>.</p><p>I‚Äôve made some modifications to the library to produce this new story view.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/github-pull-requests/story-view-1.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/github-pull-requests/story-view-2.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/github-pull-requests/story-view-3.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/github-pull-requests/story-view-4.png"></p><p><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/abozanona/abozanona.me/images/projects/github-pull-requests/story-view-5.png"></p><h2 id="Admob-Flutter"><a href="#Admob-Flutter" class="headerlink" title="Admob Flutter.
